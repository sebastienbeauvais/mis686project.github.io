								<ul>
									<li>UML Diagram Design (how entities interact with one another)</li>
									<li>Database Design (how to data created and structured)</li>
									<li>SQL Queries (how to manipulate the database to pull desired information)</li>
									<li>Web Interface (how a user would interact with the database)</li>

								<a href="images/class_diagram.jpeg" class="image fit"><img src="images/class_diagram.jpeg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>We first needed to decide what entities would be present in a veterinary clinic database. For this we created a UML diagram to view interactions between entities as well add or remove entities as needed. 
									This is where we would decide on our primary and foreign keys to easily identify objects in our database. In essence this is the skeleton for a database.</p>

								<h2>Project Summary</h2>
								<p>A problem that would require both a database and website layout as a solution would be a new veterinary practice. In our project we created fictional doctors, Mr. and Mrs. Reed, who need a database to account for the many entities of a vet. 
									Pets are classified by breed for both dogs and cats, and their names, Pet_IDS, age, and gender help identify each pet. Owners are also identified individually though an Owner_ID, while both name, phone number, and emails are also stored. 
									This would be useful for the Reeds to identify pets and their owners through the Owner_ID foreign keys. This database has many tables that are easily identifiable and are normalized, containing no many-to-many relationships.</p>
								<p>The issues that the Reeds identify in pets may lead them to prescribe medication, and since both prescriptions and medications are recorded in the database, it would be easy for them to keep track of what treatment each pet is receiving. 
									If an issue arises with a pet’s medication, information like name, brand, and cost are all stored in the medication table. 
									If the Reed’s practice becomes successful enough to expand, they can add additional doctors with their information to the Doctors table. </p>
								<p>The Reed family also need a web interface that connects to their database for better client interactions. The Appointments table contains information about Pet_IDs, Pet Names, and both date and time. 
									The table was specifically designed to only store upcoming appointments based on the current date, and will only accept times that are within working hours of the veterinary practice. 
									The table also only allows one appointment at a time, so the Reeds don’t get overbooked. This table is connected to the appointments.php page, which allows pet owners to create appointments by entering the pet names, 
									and a date and time beyond the current date. Once the appointments are scheduled, the Reeds can choose to connect each pet to a Pet_ID to avoid complications involving pets with the same name. </p>
								<p>The Reviews page is also an important tool for pet owners to write reviews on the Reed’s clinic, however some may not always be positive. 
									On the same page, users can choose to write reviews or search for previous reviews by filtering through keywords or ratings. These reviews are stored in the Reviews table, and display both a first name and date along with a rating on the webpage. 
									The other resource found on the web page is a transactions page, which obtains an Owner_ID and transaction amount, and then sends that information to the database. 
									This feature would be useful for the Reeds to keep track of how much money they have been receiving by each user. </p>
								<p>The website layout is designed so that you must first log in with a previously created account, and you must stay logged in through a session to navigate the remaining pages. 
									Each session is 24 minutes long, and certain characters won't bypass the password field, limiting potential sql injections. 
									Using this database and website design, people who want to take care of animals can have an easy time tracking pet information, and interacting with pet owners.</p>
